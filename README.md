# Deep-Learning-for-Content-Based-Filtering
DeepCBF is a Python-based project that explores the use of deep learning techniques for content-based filtering (CBF). Content-based filtering is a recommendation system approach that recommends items to users based on the similarity of item features and user preferences. This project demonstrates how deep learning models can be leveraged to improve the accuracy and performance of content-based filtering algorithms.

# Features
- Implement various deep learning architectures for content-based filtering.
- Utilize state-of-the-art neural networks for feature extraction and similarity modeling.
- Incorporate user feedback mechanisms to enhance recommendation relevance.
- Evaluate and compare the performance of different models using real-world datasets.
- Interactive visualization for model performance and recommendation results.
